    <h3>1. Passion of Christ</h3>
    <p>Truly inspiring, and captures a feeling of realization for the reason we are redeemed.</p>

    <h3>2. Lucy</h3>
    <p>Although its concepts are unfounded, the color grading feels like a match made in heaven for the story.</p>

    <h3>3. Ao Ashi</h3>
    <p>An intersting perspective on the discipline and diligence it requires to be excellent even when blessed with a natural spark.</p>
